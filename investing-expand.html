                                        invest long enough to recover any losses you may experience.

                                    This is life insurance. It is a contract between an insured and an insurer where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money (the ‘benefits’) in exchange for a premium upon the
                                    death of the insured person. Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness may also release payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or
                                    as a lump sum.
