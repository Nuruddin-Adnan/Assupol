                                        Saving is tough, especially during these tough times and involves putting money away for short-term goals or emergencies within a 12 month period. It provides low returns with low risk of losing your
                                        money. For example, growing R1 300 to R1 500 over one year in a savings account. Saving is vital and gives you the peace-of-mind to know that you can manage tricky situations should they arise. It
                                        allows you meet your financial obligations and build future wealth.

                                        One of the best ways to save money is to set a goal. Start by thinking of what you might want to save for. Then figure out how much money you will need and how long it might take you to save for it.

                                        After your expenses and income, your goals are likely to have the biggest impact on how you allocate money to your savings. Learn how to prioritise your savings goals so you have a clear idea of where
                                        to start saving e.g. if you know you are going to need to fix your car in the near future, you could start putting money away for that right now.

                                        If you are saving for short-term goals, consider using a fixed deposit account which locks in your money for a fixed period of time at a rate that is typically higher than savings accounts. For
                                        long-term goals consider tax-free savings accounts.

                                        Most banks offer automated transfers between your main bank account and savings accounts. You can choose when, how much and where to transfer money or even split your savings contribution so a set
                                        amount of your monthly salary goes directly into your savings account. Automating your savings is a simple way to save money since you don’t have to think about it, and it generally reduces the
                                        temptation to spend that money.

                                        enough, you will be motivated to stay focused to achieve it. And that is what a savings goal is; a motivating reason to save.

                                <p>
                                    This type of account allows an individual to invest in various asset classes without having to pay income tax, dividends tax or capital gains tax on the returns from these investments. These accounts can
                                    be opened with various banks, asset managers, life insurers and stockbrokers. The annual limit for individual investors in the product is currently R36 000 and the lifetime limit per investor is R500 000.
                                    Contributions must not exceed the annual individual limit of R36 000, as any contributions over and above this amount are taxed at a rate of 40%.

                                <p>
                                    A stokvel is a type of rotating savings system where a group of individuals agree to contribute a fixed amount of money to a common pool on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. Stokvels pay out their
                                    members alternately (separately and one after the other) which means that the members receive a lump sum which they can then use to buy groceries, put towards home improvements or buy something which,
                                    otherwise, they would not have been able to afford.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A unit trust is an investment that gives you easy and affordable access to financial markets like the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and the bond market, with the potential to grow your savings. Your
                                    aim should be to achieve growth that at least beats the inflation rate. A return that beats inflation is called a real return. When you invest in a unit trust, you pool your money with that of thousands
                                    of other investors in a fund and an experienced investment professional selects which shares, bonds, property shares, money market or other securities to buy for the fund.

                                <p>
                                    An investment account with a fixed term of approximately 5 years at a predetermined interest rate. These accounts typically provide a higher interest rate than other investments and require notice to
                                    access funds within a specified period. A fixed deposit helps to keep you disciplined and is an ideal way to save for future goals such as an overseas trip or your child starting school.

                                    The purpose of a budget is to give you guidelines to follow so that you can live comfortably without overspending. So consider setting limits on what you will spend at each store you often buy from (e.g.
                                    your favourite grocery or clothing store) and then commit to an amount you are willing to spend at these shops. Ensure that you stick to that limit when purchasing at those stores.

                                    Keep a list of your expected and unplanned expenses. This will help you understand exactly how much you are spending every month. This method is especially useful if you have just started saving and have
                                    no idea where all your money is going. Every month, also download your transactions into a spreadsheet (using your online banking statements), then sort your transactions by where your money was spent and
                                    then categorise each expense accordingly (e.g. restaurants, petrol, takeaways, school fees, medical aid, bond/rent, etc.) to get a clearer idea of how you’re spending your money.

                                    Various, popular apps allow you to customise your budget to suit your needs and receive weekly alerts of your spending and balances. This will help you track your transactions while giving you real-time
