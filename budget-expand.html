                                        such as these may cost. That is why it is important to budget whatever you can afford to set aside for these unplanned incidents and not be tempted to use this money if it feels like it is just
                                        “sitting there”. It takes discipline but you cannot afford to be caught unprepared and have to rely on credit or loans in instances such as these.

                                    The purpose of a budget is to give you guidelines to follow so that you can live comfortably without overspending. So consider setting limits on what you will spend at each store you often buy from (e.g.
                                    your favourite grocery or clothing store) and then commit to an amount you are willing to spend at these shops. Ensure that you stick to that limit when purchasing at those stores.
                                </p>

                                    Keep a list of your expected and unplanned expenses. This will help you understand exactly how much you are spending every month. This method is especially useful if you have just started saving and have
                                    no idea where all your money is going. Every month, also download your transactions into a spreadsheet (using your online banking statements), then sort your transactions by where your money was spent and
                                    then categorise each expense accordingly (e.g. restaurants, petrol, takeaways, school fees, medical aid, bond/rent, etc.) to get a clearer idea of how you’re spending your money.
