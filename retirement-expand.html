                                        The act of leaving one’s job, ending your career or occupation permanently, usually because of old age. Apart from a sudden change in your routine the best advice is to stay mentally and physically
                                        active and not become complacent. Be aware of inflation (which will eat into your income and assets) and, sadly, the longer you live the bigger this issue becomes. Another risk is income gap which
                                        means that your pension does not fully meet your income needs. It is crucial to have reliable income sources to fill this gap. Consider the inflation rate and taxes which can hugely impact your
                                        pension income.

                                        It is important that you contribute an adequate amount per month to your retirement fund to ensure your retirement fund pays out the desired income on retirement. Another important thing to consider
                                        is the impact of inflation which greatly reduces spending power over time. Depending on the interest rate it is estimated that over 10 years the spending value of your money could drop between 30% to
                                        40%. Over 20 years this would mean that R10 will only be worth, roughly, R3.20. Another example is that 2kg of branded rice cost R3.25 42 years ago compared to its current price of R35.99, an increase
                                        of R1100%! This means that if you are currently living comfortably on R15 000, this amount will not be enough for you to maintain the same lifestyle in 10 years’ time.

                                        This is how much you plan to save each month for retirement. It is recommended that you aim to contribute up to 10 - 15% of your annual salary to your retirement plan every year.

                                        Multiply the number of years between your current age and your desired retirement age by 12 (there are twelve months in a year). For example, if you’ve got 45 years left before you retire, you will
                                        have 540 months to save towards. Take the amount of income you think you will need to support your monthly lifestyle and compare it against the total amount of months you need to save for and commit
                                        to an amount of money you can afford to contribute monthly to achieve your goal.

                                        It is an employment condition for you to become a member of a pension fund unless if you are not permanently employed. The fund will receive contributions from yourself and your employer (monthly)
                                        which are tax deductible up to a certain limit. The purpose of this fund is to accumulate a lump sum that will pay you a pension at retirement. When you retire, you can access up to one third of the
                                        benefit in cash (which is taxable) and the remaining two thirds must be used to purchase an income annuity (which is also taxable). If your total retirement is less than R247 500, you can take the
                                        full benefit as a cash lump sum, subject to tax.

                                        A Retirement Annuity (RA) is a fund where you make monthly contributions paid from your own pocket. Anyone can buy a RA and you can have one as an addition to your pension or provident fund if you are
                                        employed. When you retire (55 years or older), you can take up a third as a cash lump sum (subject to tax) and the two thirds must be used to purchase an income annuity. If your total amount in the
                                        fund is less than R247 500, you can take the full as a cash lump sum, subject to tax. If you resign or change jobs, no difference will be made towards your RA as it is independent of your employer.

                                    It is an uncomfortable topic but, simply put, a death benefit is a payout to beneficiaries (dependants and/or other nominees) when someone who held a life insurance policy, retirement annuity or pension
                                    passes away. The death benefit is free of income tax however, in the case of annuity beneficiaries, tax may have to be paid on death benefits received. The recipients of a death benefit can receive their
                                    payout as a lump-sum, or as continued, regular payments. This is why having a will is so important – to give a clear indication of who will receive the benefit/s in this instance. Life insurance death
                                    benefits may be subject to estate tax.

                                    <span>Estate</span> planning is the process of arranging which parts of your estate will go where when you pass away which will minimise tax burdens after you pass away. The plan will include everything
                                    you owe and everything you own, e.g. cars, debt, property. A Will forms part of estate planning. This is a legal document that details your instructions about how your assets will be distributed, who your
                                    beneficiaries are and who will become the guardian of your children (if you have any) once you pass away. A will helps your family know which assets have been left to them and the state won’t have to
                                    decide what must happen to your estate. Any person over the age of 16 who has assets can have a will, even if you only have a bank account.

                                    Ensure that you have a will in place and make sure that you update it regularly especially if life events have happened. Ensure that you keep up with legislation. Let your family know where your original
                                    will is kept and give them the contact details of the person or organisation where your will is being kept.
