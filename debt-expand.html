                                        Debt is money borrowed by one party from another. Debt is used by many companies, organisations, institutions and individuals as a way of making large purchases that they cannot afford under normal
                                        circumstances. A debt arrangement is made that gives the borrowing party permission to borrow money under the agreement that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually in instalments and with
                                        interest.

                                        Good debt is money that you borrow in order to make more money and buy things that grow in value or bring a profit in future. The purpose of good debt is to enhance your financial wellbeing in the
                                        long run, not immediately. Education is a good example of what good debt should be used for as the more educated a person is, the better their career prospects are. Starting your own business is
                                        another good example because having your own business can be very rewarding, financially and for your own self-worth, even though there are always risks. Investing in your house is also considered
                                        good debt because upon reselling your home you should make a profit.

                                        Bad debt occurs when money is borrowed for buying things that will devalue in the future. Essentially bad debt is when borrowed money will be lost or unrecoverable on an investment. A good example of
                                        this is buying a car which loses its value from the moment you drive it off the showroom floor. Borrowing money for clothes, furniture and even food are other examples of bad debt because, while we
                                        need these things, they will bring no profit after their purchase.

                                                Divide this amount by your net monthly salary to get your debt-to-income ratio e.g. Debt R20 000 ÷ Income R18 000 = 1.11. This means that for every rand earned, you have R1.11 rand of debt.
                                                Ideally, your income should be greater than your debt. For example: for every R10 you have R7 should be income and R3 should be debt. This would be a ratio of 7:3.

                                    A bank loan is a fixed amount for a fixed term with regular fixed repayments. The interest on a loan tends to be lower than an overdraft. You might be forced to take out life insurance to get the loan,
                                    which is an added expense. Take care over the small print.

                                    finance borrowed against immovable property, using that property as security for the loan.

                                    This is an arrangement for buying expensive items, where the buyer makes an initial down payment and pays the balance, plus interest, in instalments over time. In this agreement, the item bought will only
                                    qualify to be taken home by the buyer once all the payments have been made.
                                </p>

                                    An open-ended credit account - like a credit card or other “line of credit”- that can be used and paid off repeatedly as long as the account remains open. It is automatically renewed every time the money
                                    borrowed is fully paid off.
